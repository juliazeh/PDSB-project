## Final code review

1. Chloe's README files made it very clear what the project is and provided links for navigation to the notebooks. Anika's was also very clear in explaining the project and how to proceed in looking at her work, and so did Wenyi I think my README file does a good job of this, but could be better at explaining the overall purpose of the project, as I did in my proposal.

2. Chloe has a directory named project, but this directory redirects the user to her notebooks folder where all the data is stored. Wenyi does not have a directory named project. Anika had a notebook stored in the project directory.

3. Anika's notebook in the notebooks directory was incredibly clear and thorough. Chloe's was also very clear and links to the notebooks were provided in the project repository README. Wenyi's notebooks were also very clear. The notebooks in all three of these user's repositories explained clearly how the code works, how to use it, and the problem they are trying to solve through the notebook.

4. Reviewing my peer's projects, I think it would be a good idea to connect all of the repositories through links in the main README file and also to provide the equivalent of an Introduction in a journal article in this README in order to introduce the subject and the problem before leading into the methods through the notebooks. The results can then also be displayed in the notebooks, as my peers did, and then the viewer can try these methods out themself.
