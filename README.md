# Final project - Acoustics in Python

### The Sounds library

The Sounds library can be found under projects. There is a readme file in the Sounds repository which explains how to install and use the library. This library can be used to visualize a spectrogram, waveform, and periodogram using a .wav file. A sample .wav file to be used with this program is located in the data repository. Finally, under the notebooks repository there is a notebook called SoundFileSNR-Final.ipynb which walks you through the code and then imports and uses the Sounds library.

### Getting Started with pyAudioAnalysis

For this project, an attempt was made at using the pyAudioAnalysis library, however, I have concluded that the library is too difficult to use and needs better documentation, tutorials, and other functions. Under the Notebooks repository, you will find Getting Started with pyAudioAnalysis.ipynb, a notebook which shows my project attempting to learn this library.

### Documents

Documents related to my intial proposal, final essay, and code reviews can be found in the Documents repository.
